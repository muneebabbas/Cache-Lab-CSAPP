# Cache-Lab-CSAPP
This is the solution to the cache Lab from CS:APP along with some added functions we were
supposed to write as part of Multicore Computing Course at LUMS taught by Dr. Junaid Haroon.
The assignment included writing a cache simulator and a cache aware transpose functions for different sized matrices.
